## üîß Technical Implementation Strategy

### File Analysis Required:
1. **Original Files to Extract**:
   - `App.css` (commit 4e872e1)
   - `GameBoard.css` (commit 4e872e1) 
   - `GameBoard.jsx` structure (commit 4e872e1)
   - Any component CSS files that were in use

2. **Current Files to Modify**:
   - `client/App.css`
   - `client/components/games/GameBoard.css`
   - `client/components/games/VetrolisciBoard.css`
   - `client/components/games/VetrolisciBoard.jsx`

### Path Adaptation Required:
- Update any absolute paths to work with new `client/` structure
- Fix asset references to use `client/public/`
- Adjust import paths for the new component hierarchy

### Verification Methods:
1. **Visual Comparison**: Screenshot comparison if possible
2. **Functional Testing**: Ensure all original functionality preserved
3. **Responsive Testing**: Test various screen sizes
4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify compatibility

## üìã Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete:
- ‚úÖ Original files extracted and analyzed
- ‚úÖ Specific differences documented
- ‚úÖ Clear restoration roadmap established

### Phase 2 Complete:
- ‚úÖ CSS foundation matches original
- ‚úÖ Color schemes and typography restored
- ‚úÖ Global styles working correctly

### Phase 3 Complete:
- ‚úÖ Component structure matches original
- ‚úÖ All HTML elements and classes present
- ‚úÖ Layout hierarchy restored

### Final Success:
- ‚úÖ Vetrolisci visually identical to commit 4e872e1
- ‚úÖ All animations and interactions working
- ‚úÖ Responsive design matching original
- ‚úÖ No visual regressions from refactoring

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues:
1. **Path Dependencies**: New folder structure may require extensive path updates
2. **CSS Conflicts**: New VetrolisciBoard.css may conflict with original styles
3. **Component Props**: Router changes may have affected prop passing
4. **Asset Loading**: Vite configuration may affect asset serving

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Incremental Restoration**: Restore one component at a time
2. **Backup Current State**: Save current working state before major changes
3. **Test Frequently**: Test after each major change
4. **Document Changes**: Track what works and what breaks

## üéØ Priority Order

1. **üö® CRITICAL**: CSS foundation and component structure (Phases 1-3)
2. **üî• HIGH**: Asset paths and basic functionality (Phase 4)
3. **‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM**: Animations and interactions (Phase 5)
4. **üìã LOW**: Responsive design and polish (Phases 6-7)

This plan provides a systematic approach to restore Vetrolisci to its original stable appearance while preserving the new multi-game architecture.
