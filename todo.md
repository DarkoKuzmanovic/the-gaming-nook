## üìã **TODO - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

### Game Flow & Mechanics

- [x] **Create Proper 70-Card Deck** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - All 70 cards implemented from CSV data
  - Card shuffling and distribution working
  - Proper randomization in place

- [x] **Turn-Based Draft Phase** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - 4-card reveal system implemented
  - Alternating pick mechanics (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P1)
  - Complete turn order tracking and validation
  - Real-time draft UI with visual feedback

  - Complete game state synchronization between players
  - Lobby system with matchmaking
  - Player connection/disconnection handling
  - Real-time draft phase with turn validation

- [ ] **Card Placement Phase for Multiplayer**
  - Implement real-time card placement synchronization
  - Handle all 3 placement scenarios in multiplayer
  - Add turn-based placement mechanics
  - Validate moves on server side

- [ ] **Round End Conditions**
  - Detect when player fills all 9 spaces
  - Implement 2-player equal turns rule
  - Add between-round transitions
  - Reset grids for new rounds

## üìã **TODO - TESTING**

### Various fixes

- [ ] **Visuals**

  - In revealed-cards-section class please show the card images instead of rendering only text.
  - Make scoreboard collapsible and default is to be collapsed
  - Player grids should have ratio as cards have it, so they don't get trimmed.

- [ ] ** Functional**

  - Player hands go P1>P2>P1>P2, then in second shuffle it's P2>P1>P2>P1. Third shuffle also begins with P1>P2>P1>P2. Basically, one who finishes the hand, starts the next one.
