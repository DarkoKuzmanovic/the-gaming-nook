- ‚úÖ Real-time 2-player matchmaking and lobby
- ‚úÖ Complete draft phase with turn-based card picking and proper card images
- ‚úÖ All 70 card assets properly integrated throughout the UI
- ‚úÖ Beautiful UI with actual designed card images in all phases
- ‚úÖ Stable Socket.io multiplayer infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Card placement system (single-player mode)
- ‚úÖ Complete scoring system with all rules
- ‚úÖ 3x3 grid system with proper card aspect ratios
- ‚úÖ Collapsible scoreboard interface
- ‚úÖ Correct draft hand order alternation between rounds

### **Ready for Testing:**
Players can now:
1. Enter their names and join a lobby
2. Get automatically matched with another player
3. Play through the complete draft phase with beautiful card images
4. Pick cards in alternating turns with proper round-based order
5. See properly proportioned grids that match card dimensions
6. Use collapsible scoreboard to manage screen space
7. Experience consistent visual design throughout gameplay

## üìÇ **Key Files Modified This Session**
